= Extending metrics

User Apps and other SDK Modules can send their own metrics at any time.

== App and device metrics

App and device metrics are sent by default when metrics server is enabled in `mobile-config.json` configuration.

== Contributing to SDK by adding new metrics 

Users can also create their own metrics by extending `Metrics` prototype. 

1.Create new metrics by extending `Metrics` prototype
[source,swift]
----
 public class MyMetrics: Metrics {
    public private(set) var identifier: String = "mymetricsid"
    public func collect() -> MetricsData {
        return ["mylabel","my value"]
    }
 }
----
2. Append metrics to metrics container  
[source,swift]
----
AgsCore.instance.getMetrics().publish(MyMetrics())
----

 == Replacing default metrics publisher

Developers can provide custom publishers to change the way metrics are sent or stored:

[source,swift]
----
MyPublisher publisher: MetricsPublisher = MyPublisher()
AgsCore.instance.getMetrics().setMetricsPublisher(publisher) 
----
