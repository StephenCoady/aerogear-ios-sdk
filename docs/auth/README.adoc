= AeroGear Services Auth SDK

Mobile authentication SDK based on link:http://www.keycloak.org/[Keycloak] using link:http://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect].

== Usage

To use the Auth SDK you'll first need to:

* Have a Keycloak instance.
* Import the Core module. See link:./core/README.adoc[the Core documentation].
* A configuration file added to the app directory. See the <<Configuration File>> section.

=== Adding Dependency

Add dependency to your Podfile:

```
pod 'AGSAuth'
```

=== Configuration File

A `mobile-services.json` file must exist in the app directory. It should specify configuration
for Keycloak. This configuration can be generated by the link:https://github.com/aerogear/mobile-cli[AeroGear Mobile CLI].

For an example of Keycloak configuration see the example apps link:../../example/AeroGearSdkExample/mobile-services.json[mobile-services.json].

The Auth SDK will use this configuration to communicate with Keycloak.
